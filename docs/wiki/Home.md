# Lost & Found (Privacy-first, QR-based)

Welcome to the project wiki. This Open Source service enables privacy-preserving lost-and-found via QR tags, anonymous first contact, optional relay chat, and status-driven notifications ("not lost" vs. "lost"). Goals: minimal data collection, fast UX, simple serverless ops.

## Key features
- Anonymous first contact with optional location/share consent
- Owner login only for managing tags and replies
- "Not lost" inbox buffering, deliver on "lost" status
- Auto-deletion with TTL; optional success-based payment or donations
