# {{ tag_name | lower }}_handler_impl.py
"""Handler implementation for the '{{ tag_name }}' tag.

THIS FILE IS AUTO-GENERATED AND WILL BE OVERWRITTEN ON EVERY GENERATION RUN.

All user code blocks between
    # -- BEGIN USER CODE: ... --
and
    # -- END USER CODE: ... --
are always preserved.
Unmatched user code blocks are collected at the end of the file to prevent data loss.

IMPORTANT:
- Each user code block starts with a '# DEFAULT USER CODE:' marker by default.
- As long as this marker is present, your code will be replaced by the generator (e.g. after yapf/formatting).
- If you change or remove the marker, your code will be considered 'custom' and will NOT be overwritten by future generations.
- This mechanism ensures that formatting errors or accidental changes to default blocks are automatically corrected, while your own code is always preserved.
